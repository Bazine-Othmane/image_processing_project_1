# Image Processing Desktop Application

This desktop application is built using Python and PyQt5 to process images. It provides various image-processing functionalities including:

- Converting images from RGB to grayscale
- Converting images from HSV to grayscale
- Converting images from RGB to HSV
- Quantizing images
- Generating grayscale-level histograms
- Adjusting pixel image dynamics
- Histogram equalization
- Denoising images

## Usage
1. Run the application using the following command: python window_main.py
2. The application will open, providing a user-friendly interface for image processing.
3. Choose an image from your computer to perform various processing tasks.
4. there is a saving service if you want to save the images after processing.
## Features

### RGB to Grayscale Conversion

Converts an image from RGB color space to grayscale.

### HSV to Grayscale Conversion

Converts an image from HSV color space to grayscale.

### RGB to HSV Conversion

Converts an image from RGB color space to HSV.

### Image Quantization

Reduces the number of colors in an image, creating a quantized effect.

### Grayscale Level Histogram

Generates and displays the histogram of grayscale levels in the image.

### Adjusting Pixel Image Dynamics

Allows users to adjust the dynamic range of pixel values in the image.

### Histogram Equalization

Enhances the contrast of the image using the histogram equalization technique.

### Denoising

Applies denoising algorithms to reduce noise in the image.
